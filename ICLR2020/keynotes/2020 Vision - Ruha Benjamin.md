- "We have guided missiles and misguided men", Dr. Martin Luther King on overinvestment in tech/automated weapons and underinvestment in social and moral compass when it comes to tech
- need to develop tech that is human, just, fair, equitable
	- rethink how we reduce everything to binaries -- eg is tech going to save us or slay us?
	- rethink the power dynamics that shape tech
- rethink deep learning
	- need historical and sociological depth instead of just computational depth
		- ML practicioners should learn/be aware of how technology has been used in the past, to avoid unwittingly giving rise to similar situtations in the present -- get a bigger picture of what you are building in a little corner of the field might be affecting the rest of the world
		- discern more clearly how we may unwittinly be building in form of harm and social exclusion
		- race/gender neutral tech that does not take such info as an explicit input can recreate the problem due to biases built into the data in proxy features -- called coded bias
		- tech can hide ongoing social domination, allowing it to penetrate every facet of our lives, under the guise of progress
-- "innovation and inequity too often go hand-in-hand, unless we design carefully, with questions of equity at the forefrunt of what we are doing and not as an after thought"
- the new jim code on a spectrum of visibility of the bias
	a. engineering inequity -- explicity seek to amplify social cleavages; for some people to move forward others must be contained; most visible
	b. default discrimination -- reinforce inequities coz tech designers fail to attend to the social and historical context of their work
	c. coded exposure -- some tech fail to see racial differences while others might render racialized people hypervisible and exposed to systems of surveillance
	d. techno-benevolence -- claim to address bias of certain sorts, but might reproduce/deepen biases due to the way fairness is defined and operationalized
