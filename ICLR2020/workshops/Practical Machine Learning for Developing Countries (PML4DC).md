- need more open data -- people interested in doing cool stuff, but most of the time data is not (freely) available
- data/visualization literacy -- be careful while picking up the viz format coz they might look fancy, but might not be most insightful or might not tell the full story
- be careful of shiny black boxes -- be sure that you understand your data and the tools/models you use; make sure to analyze your results, don't just look at the aggregate scalar values;
- viz analytics empowers your users

- Phases of a Machine learning pipeline:
	- problem definition
	- data collection and pre-processing
	- model development
	- integration into practice

- collaborative problem definition is key -- many people involved, though this brings forth multipe unique view points, it can also lead to potential for miscommunication; people's understanding is colored by their experiences, therefore necessary to come to an agreed up glossary of terms and concepts
- need to check who/what is being represented by the data and who/what is not -- eg covid-19 data is currently not giving a full picture of how the confirmed cases are determined, some countries are performing mass tests, while others are only testing high risk indivs, hence making the data not comparable
- need to be creative while putting together datasets -- US, Europe and parts of Asia data overload, while developing countries find it difficult to create a data exhaust
- Use exisiting datasets that show similar outcomes to augment collected data -- but be aware of contextual factors like culture, geography etc.
- important to have explainability for planning interventions -- eg tools that can help stakeholders interact with the different features and see how they interact to affect the outcome; allows stakeholders to ask many more questions; allows to see how the deployed model reacts to different values
- integrations of ML models can still be hard even after performing the above steps, esp when all businesses involved are not digitized and work-arounds for the problem exist
- lot more work to be done to ensure that the tools will be adopted and impactful
- one-size-fits-all views of ML in developed countries cannot adequately the developing world
